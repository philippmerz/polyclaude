- [Live performance chart](https://philippmerz.github.io/polyclaude/) — [CSV and methodology](docs/README.md).

The local performance CSV now has 280 recorded observations from Apr-25
through Oct-23. Rounded reconstructions are labeled; unsupported historical
values stay blank. The [source audit](research/2026-10-06-performance-history.json)
records remaining gaps and accounting limits.

These views cover **two different wallets**. The Polymarket wallet also holds
pUSD cash, Polygon Aave deposits and POL gas; the crypto wallet's balance alone
is only part of the account. The dashboard below combines both wallets and
market positions without double-counting.

Autonomous, agent-directed trading pilot. The mandate is to maximize legal
expected compounded return through the start-of-2027 evaluation, using only the
repository's vetted execution paths.

**Last maintained:** 2026-10-23. Portfolio figures below are a timestamped
snapshot; run the status commands for live state.


## Start here

1. Read [`MANDATE.md`](MANDATE.md).
2. Read [`strategy/00_philosophy.md`](strategy/00_philosophy.md) and
   [`strategy/01_lessons.md`](strategy/01_lessons.md).
3. Read [`strategy/02_operations.md`](strategy/02_operations.md) for wallets,
   daemons, Telegram, execution, and emergency procedures.
4. Run `.venv/bin/python scripts/polyclaude_status.py`.

This file is the current dashboard and entry point. Chronology belongs in
[`notes/journal.md`](notes/journal.md), pending work in
[`notes/backlog.md`](notes/backlog.md), and dated analysis in `research/`.

The [compact handoff](notes/current_context.md) indexes the completed selection,
current orders and dated financial evidence; check its expiry and source hashes.
The active lessons guide is condensed; its [original ledger](strategy/archive/01_lessons_2026-10-12.md)
remains historical evidence. `scripts/context_packet.py` builds bounded packets
for four task scopes without loading full history or live state. Packets are
orientation only; the required strategy reads and live execution checks remain.

Writing default for replies, handoffs and maintained documents:

- Lead with the result; use concise bullets with one claim or action each.
- Preserve relevant facts, numbers, identities, dates, assumptions, uncertainty,
  conditions and evidence links. Shorten wording, not information.
- Keep a detail when it changes interpretation, a decision, uncertainty or
  verification; otherwise link supporting material instead of repeating it.
- Remove repetition and filler; retain enough grammar to read once. Use tables
  for comparisons and short headings for navigation; avoid cryptic shorthand
  and multi-topic bullets. Follow a specifically requested format when it differs.

## Completed-universe selection — October21

**The broad experiment ended at 422 completed unique valuations; no 600-case wait or queue continuation.** There is no active native goal (verified13:25UTC). Counts: 422 valued, 394 factual exclusions, 21 blocked, 2,163 unfinished pending; 837 base records plus 78 revisions. Case529 is unfinished and excluded. Policy v2 permits autonomous selection from the completed universe, subject to primary comparison, exact selected outcome tokens, hashed report and every live entry gate. [Policy](notes/entry_review_gate.json) · [Selection and comparison](research/2026-10-21-completed-review-allocation.json).

**Current allocation:** Delcy (#300) holds 28 YES/$5.04; October Fed no dissent (#179) holds 19.993158 YES/$4.798358 after a 14.73-share maker fill at 24¢; December Fed (#511) holds 20 YES/$3.80. pUSD is $5.612932; no visible open orders. The exact 179 order still returns JSON `null`, so its terminal state is unknown; keep the full $4.80 reservation and global BUY block. [Fill proof](research/2026-10-22-1208-fill-reconciliation.json) · [Latest order status](notes/resting_orders.md).

**Management:** retain holdings/no add after the 11:18 requested-news review; no numeric prior, verification-date or DEC change. Anthropic’s Sept10 retrospective routing/training allegations are material to Kimi source admission and future access, but no affected HLE run, qualifying score or withdrawal is identified; they do not establish a specific probability change. TNW/Korben bodies and K3.1 identity remain unverified. ESPN editions share a headline with body/date unresolved; no measured Google ranking evidence. NTN24/related EFE Delcy coverage appears to concern the same Oct22 dialogue cycle, with no new legal instrument or timetable. [Latest check](research/2026-10-23-1118-check.json) · [News decisions](research/2026-10-23-1118-news-decisions.json) · [Held-source review](research/2026-10-23-1118-held-review.json). Delcy held-source review remains Oct24 13UTC; December Fed review remains before/after October’s decision.

## Mandate and constraints

- Reference trading capital: **$170**. Separately contributed gas is tracked
  independently in [`notes/capital_ledger.md`](notes/capital_ledger.md).
- Each project position must fit a **less-than-one-year** holding horizon.
  Off-chain stocks and personal-brokerage research are outside this project.
- Normal Dec. 31 resolutions redeemed in the first days of January count for
  the start-of-2027 evaluation. Do not cross a costly spread merely to print
  cash on Dec. 31.
- Venues must be lawful and decentralized; no CEX or KYC venue.
- Expected return, fees, depth, correlation, uncertainty, settlement time,
  and operational risk all enter each decision.
- Scheduled runs are bounded. Cron and event watchers handle waiting between
  reviews.

On-demand copper research on Oct 10 verified Ostium XCU/USD and Hyperliquid
XYZ `xyz:COPPER` listings. Copper remains a [manual candidate](notes/longterm_watchlist.md):
recurring carry, the January horizon and route/eligibility requirements do not
establish an allocation. No position or new watcher was added.

## Last audited snapshot — October 23 11:19 UTC

**Canonical bankroll: $196.39 including $5.77 separately contributed gas.** Trading value is $190.62 at midpoint or $188.24 at indicative fee-net depth (+10.7% versus $170); same-producer PM values are $50.28/$47.90. The $19.75 residual is unaudited; VM/API costs are excluded. Sequential estimates are not synchronized NAV or guaranteed proceeds. The CSV has 280 observations, preserving its 279-row prefix; the 10 chart tests passed once. [Financial snapshot](research/2026-10-23-1119-financial-snapshot.json).

**No new trade or fill:** 12 all-size positions, 132 confirmed trade IDs, pUSD $5.612932 and zero visible orders. All 12 financial identity/cost tuples and selected CTF balances are unchanged. Mark-only changes since 09:46: December Fed YES $4.60→$4.50 and OpenRouter NO $2.925→$2.875. Current indicative exits are OR $2.70 and whole Clarity $27.31; other held exits are unchanged, including Delcy $5.04. Conservative gross exposure plus the full reservation is $55.8623514 versus 27%/$53.0253 and 30%/$58.917 at this bankroll; caps do not authorize entry. The October Fed order remains terminal-unknown; its full $4.80 reservation and new-BUY block remain. Audit clean, zero ack drops, UMA/diff clear, seven hurdle clears, no watchlist hits, zero Ostium positions, no overdue decisions, four daemons one each. [Completed check](research/2026-10-23-1118-check.json).

Fifteen new rows and one older requested observation were reviewed through 11:18:04 (15 unique IDs; all six requested IDs and ten related rows assessed). Retain holdings/no add/no prior/date/DEC changes. Kimi/Messi primary source review retains 10 YES/$1.20 and 5 YES/$1.35; low-admission/competitor cases favor cash and either full stake can lose. Exact captured books show zero-fee exits $1.00/$1.45, but do not verify HLE score or Google Top-5 rank. OpenRouter chart/book review remains dated 09:48 and was not refreshed; selected pNO .73 remains unchanged, with current 11:18 exit analysis $2.70 plus carry still below selected $3.65. [News decisions](research/2026-10-23-1118-news-decisions.json) · [Held-source review](research/2026-10-23-1118-held-review.json).

The full 02UTC discovery pass is retained: seven scans and two compressed batch builds, with 3,080 unvalued row observations and explicit caps. Four literal-rule checks and three source checks established no complete new valuation. [Coverage](research/2026-10-23-0200-discovery.json) · [Focused cases](research/2026-10-23-0200-discovery-cases.json).

**Weekly review completed at 00:34:** Oct16–23 trading midpoint fell $0.30 (−0.16%); indicative depth fell $1.38 (−0.73%), before unreconciled VM/API costs. Summary already sent to Telegram; next weekly Oct30. [Weekly review](research/2026-10-23-weekly-review.json).

## On-demand Base stock-token review — Oct 9 11:10 UTC

Coinbase B20 AAPLc/MSFTc/NVDAc have small-ticket Slipstream quotes losing about
0.10% on a buy/reverse pair before gas and funding. MSFTc/NVDAc are
[manual on-chain candidates](notes/longterm_watchlist.md); no allocation was
made. Issuer redemption requires KYC vesting, so a no-KYC position relies on
DEX liquidity and must account for issuer controls and legal eligibility.
The measured route still needs a vetted Slipstream writer and a return thesis
through January. The review also repaired the existing Base Uniswap quoter
and Router02 call configuration; 15 focused tests passed. See the
[research and validation record](notes/journal.md).

## Operating model

- **Reactive:** `news_watcher.py` and `opportunity_watch.py` monitor material
  events and can trigger a bounded review.
- **Scheduled:** full checks run at 02:00 and 14:00 UTC; light checks run at
  06:00, 10:00, 18:00, and 22:00 UTC. On-chain opportunity research is on demand.
- **Health:** `heartbeat_watch.py` checks daemon freshness, session progress,
  and disk headroom.
- **Storage:** snapshots use compact gzip JSON; shared batch context is stored
  once. Scheduled check-ins losslessly archive closed artifacts. The
  [October21 pass](research/2026-10-21-storage-efficiency.json) reclaimed498MB
  while preserving exact evidence and financial hashes.
- **Interactive:** authenticated Telegram messages enter the same ordered
  operator queue.

Discovery snapshots can be organized with `scripts/market_context_batches.py`.
Its offline batches carry no model or execution authority and do not replace
complete scanner, literal-criteria, or live-book review.

On Oct 17, a finite diagnostic completed **3,000 primary-model first-pass
screens**, including 73 full literal-rule or PDF reviews and 17 family
investigations at varying depth. Most markets remain unpriced; this is not
3,000 fully underwritten rejections. The pass found and fixed a category-routing
bug: substring ETH matched “whether”, ordinary dollar thresholds matched crypto,
and “primary source” boilerplate matched politics. Forty-seven focused checks
passed. The frozen sample changed 971 labels; that is not a gold-set accuracy or
ROI result. Routine discovery had selected 2,691 conditions but documented only
four full literal reviews. Selection totals do not measure substantive coverage.
No new entry was justified by the detailed checks; no order was placed. See the
[individual ledger](research/2026-10-17-primary-market-review.csv),
[audit and case findings](research/2026-10-17-primary-market-review.json), and
[frozen public rules](research/2026-10-17-primary-market-review-rules.jsonl.gz).
The [review checkpoint](notes/market_review_checkpoint.json) indexes incremental
local ledgers and the unresolved queue for resumption after compaction.

The [Oct 12 opportunity-method review](research/2026-10-12-opportunity-method-review.md)
fixed discovery filter ordering, exposed incomplete coverage, removed the failed
favorite-population forecasts and diversified bounded basket quoting. The
[review workflow](strategy/03_opportunity_method.md) uses cheap factual triage,
then primary judgment on both-side economics and all accessible on-chain
alternatives. Wider discovery counts establish additional review work, not
profitable trades.

The [finite-context architecture](research/2026-10-12-finite-context-architecture.md)
adds an offline shadow prototype for reusable source analysis, versioned case
memory and joint-scenario projections. One eleven-contract replay reduced full
packet bytes by 41.1% with lossless supplied rules and tested invalidation. No forecast
quality, live edge or token-billing savings are established by that replay.

That implementation is an offline prototype. Live model-review routing and a
prospectively validated source-family strategy remain proposed work; neither
has been deployed as an automatic trading controller.

Broad book scanners use `scripts/clob_books.py` to chunk public `POST /books`
reads at the venue's 500-token limit and join only on `asset_id`. Missing,
conflicting, stale, malformed, or crossed books fail closed. These non-atomic
snapshots are advisory; any action still requires a fresh final book rewalk.

New Polymarket buys must use `scripts/polyclaude_enter.py`, which enforces
identity, criteria, fee, robust-EV, ticket, cluster, collateral, and reservation
checks. Direct raw buys are blocked. Existing-position sells and verified
cancels use `scripts/clob_v2.py`. Protected multi-leg structures come from
`_groups` in [`notes/portfolio_kelly_priors.json`](notes/portfolio_kelly_priors.json)
and must be managed as complete economic positions.

The `clob_v2.py orders` display annotates an order with its canonical slug only
when both condition ID and token ID exactly match the position snapshot. Unknown
or duplicate identities remain explicitly unmapped or ambiguous.

Resting orders are reconciled against the authenticated CLOB every check.
The news watcher includes validated pending BUY exposure as well as holdings;
unavailable Polymarket inventory passes alerts through for review.
Ordinary public-information positions may rest maker sells at or above fair.
Hidden-information positions require a documented premium strictly above fair;
all scheduled-catalyst orders are pulled before the event. See
[`notes/resting_orders.md`](notes/resting_orders.md).

Emergency actions follow the three-layer check in
[`strategy/02_operations.md`](strategy/02_operations.md): independent source
corroboration, consistent market reaction, and on-chain ground truth.

## Telegram

Outbound shell replies use `.venv/bin/python scripts/telegram.py msg --stdin` with a
single-quoted heredoc so currency and shell metacharacters remain literal.
Inbound prompts use the private one-time reader: `ALREADY_CLAIMED` means take
no action and send no duplicate; `EXPIRED` means request a fresh resend without
acting on unrevealed text.
